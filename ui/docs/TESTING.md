## Running locally

```
pnpm test              # unit + contract + component (145 tests across 22 files)
pnpm test:coverage     # with v8 coverage + enforced thresholds (70% lines/funcs/stmts, 60% branches)
pnpm e2e               # Playwright smoke + responsive/DPI + experience suite (12 tests)
pnpm visual:compare    # verifies captured Playwright step screenshots against corpus geometry
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm arch:lint && pnpm bundle:check
```

## Key guarantees asserted by tests

- **Determinism**: identical seeds produce identical device lists, pages,
  preview payloads, and recovery outcomes.
- **Timing budgets** (mock contract): pause/resume < 600 ms, cancel ≤ 300 ms,
  filter query < 200 ms on the standard scenario (grid #36).
- **Monotonicity & 100% completion**: overall scan progress never regresses
  across a full run, reaches `1.0` even when `quick-index` is omitted on a
  damaged volume (`bad-sectors`), and reports exact 100% `filesFound` /
  `dataFoundBytes` upon completion.
- **Path-tree 3-branch partition**: `root` (`Existing files`), `lost-paths`,
  and `raw-all` partition the result space into disjoint sets with zero
  double-counting.
- **Zero-byte poor confidence**: `sizeBytes === 0` files are graded `poor`
  per `CRecoverability::GetEntryRecoverability`.
- **One-shot disconnect injection**: fires once; resume (the reconnect
  acknowledgment) restores `deviceConnected` and continues.
- **Hard overlap refusal**: `validateDestination` rejects same-volume
  destinations with `reason: 'overlap'`.
- **Repair consent**: `applyRepair` without the `REPAIR` token throws
  `repair-consent-required`; the undo log round-trips.
- **Stub truthfulness**: every tauri-adapter method throws
  `not-implemented` pointing at CONNECTOR-CONTRACT.md.

## Accessibility testing

- Component tests assert `role="progressbar"` + aria-value attributes on
  the gauge and capacity bars, labeled checkboxes, and badge labeling
  (color never the only signal).
- Playwright drives the full path via accessible roles/names only — the
  smoke suite doubles as a keyboard/AT operability check.
- Automated axe-core 4.10 audit across all surfaces and all 6 palettes
  (per-surface axe JSONs in `docs/evidence/a11y/`): 0 violations.

## CI matrix

- `ci.yml` (windows-latest): frozen install → typecheck → lint → format →
  arch (3 layers) → knip → jscpd → `pnpm test:coverage` → build → bundle budget →
  cargo check + clippy → artifact upload.
- `ui-smoke.yml`: preview-server Playwright run (12 tests) + step screenshots +
  reports; a secondary job proves the Tauri debug bundle links
  (`tauri build --debug --no-bundle`) without `continue-on-error`.
- `visual-compare.yml` (`workflow_dispatch`): runs `pnpm e2e` + `pnpm visual:compare`
  and uploads the step screenshots and comparison summary artifact.
- `release.yml` (tag `v*`): version match gate, NSIS bundle, SHA-256,
  unsigned-artifact disclosure in release notes.

## Live verification evidence (this session)

Eight step screenshots under the session workspace (`verify-01..08`):
home, scan config, completion modal, results 3-pane, filter bar open,
preview pane populated, destination dialog, recovery report — full golden
path with **0 page errors** and no console errors (React DevTools notice
filtered as benign). Two real defects were caught and fixed during this
pass (see worklog): the row-checkbox double-toggle and a Radix
RadioGroupItem context misuse that the error boundary surfaced.
