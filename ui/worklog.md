# Worklog — recovery-wizard-ui-new

Multi-session work log. Append-only; newest at the bottom. Format per SOP:
what / why / evidence / next.

---

## Session 1 — 2026-10-23 (UI Mock session)

### T1 — Corpus pull, repo skeleton, governance docs — DONE

- Cloned research corpus `easeus-drw-research` (1.7 GB, 11,495 files) to
  `/home/z/my-project/easeus-drw-research` (read-only reference; never integrated).
- Verified toolchain: Node 24.21, npm 11.19, git 2.47, Python 3.12 + PIL (icon generation).
  No cargo locally — Rust side compiles in Windows CI only; Node side builds locally.
- Created private GitHub repo `heicfast/recovery-wizard-ui-new` (default branch `main`).
- Local skeleton at `/home/z/my-project/recovery-wizard-ui-new/`: `docs/`, `docs/adr/`,
  `worklog/`, `scripts/`. Remote authenticated via token stored in `.git/config` only.
- Saved redacted session prompt to `worklog/session-ui-mock-prompt.md`.

### Research extraction (reading pass, evidence → docs later)

Read, in full or in targeted depth:

- `architecture/00-INDEX.md` — master index; scale of extraction.
- `architecture/07-user-flow-uiux.md` — screen-by-screen flows, scan modes, results/preview/
  recovery/repair surfaces, 4-page stacked wizard (QStackedWidget: Home / LostDisk /
  PeripheralHome / DetailPage — scan runs INSIDE the results page).
- `architecture/05-uiux-architecture.md` — design system facts: brand blue #0560fd light /
  #5094ff dark; CTA gradients #0c99ff→#0560fd (light) / #059afd→#0ccdff (dark); success
  #30b373; warn #f72c2c / #ffc10e; 4-step neutral ladder #e7e7e7/#dee1ed/#c1ccdf/#a0a6b1;
  shadows rgba(4,5,43,.5) light / rgba(28,28,28,.5) dark; Segoe UI 14px base + zh/ja/ko CJK
  stacks; window 1240×840 normal / 800×600 min, opens maximized; dialog 540×240; icon
  standards 48/56/72/80; 118-slot dual palette (light/dark) hot-swappable; dark surfaces
  #1b1d1f/#202428/#32383e, text #f1f5ff, orange accent #ff7342, borders #404c63/#596680.
- `artifacts/UIUX/35-redesign-reference-atlas.md` — THE rebuild reference: title-bar strip,
  landing map (sidebar sections Data Recovery / Advanced Features / File Backup; device tiles
  with capacity bars; Specify-a-location trio; Search CTA bottom-right), scan-phase controls
  (circular % gauge bottom-left, pause/stop, Searching strip, Recover All CTA bottom-right),
  celebration modal (stats grid + Go to Recover), results 3-pane map (toolbar nav cluster +
  breadcrumb + view toggle + filter + search; filter bar row; select-all + sortable columns;
  bottom status + contextual CTA), context menu 6 items, filter dropdown option sets
  (Type/Date/Size/custom + toggles), destination dialog anatomy (Local/Cloud tabs, drive rows
  with space stats, Choose folder, repair toggle ON default, Save disabled until selection,
  overwrite warning, insufficient-space gate), preview surfaces, 15 dynamically-proven
  interaction rules.
- `artifacts/UIUX/05-styling-theming-layout.md` — QSS/theming layer facts (three-layer style
  system, tooltip spec, scrollbar specs, page margins, data-driven configs:
  PriorityDisplayType.xml, usefullostfiles.xml, RawConfig.ini per-extension carve flags).
- `architecture/04-recovery-workflow.md` — engine-side flow: scan setup factories (FS codes),
  quick vs advanced (full searcher set + RAW carver), tree building → classify (FileFilter.xml
  8 categories / 1,489 extensions) → check → filter → sort; preview subsystem; CRecoveryMgr
  export chain with destination validation (raw volume open, same-volume detection); .rsf
  session persistence (zlib-chunked records: flags → volume name + timestamp → scan metadata
  → full tree); failure paths.
- `artifacts/UIUX/19-diskhealth-quick-ui.md` — SMART table shape: ID / Attribute / Current /
  Worst / Threshold / Raw / Status + health states Good/Caution; disk selector + caution card.
- `artifacts/PartitionRecovery/rawfixer-fs-repair.md` — transactional repair model: Check*
  probes → FixDBR / FixFromDBR / FixByScanSector → UpdateDBR → verify → Undo; per-FS fixer
  matrices (NTFS/FAT/exFAT); CopySectors undo snapshots.

Screenshot corpus inventoried: 63 files across 7 areas (splash 2, landing 21, scan-phase 7,
scan-complete 2, results 14, preview 2, recovery 15). VLM extraction next (T2).

### Decisions (pre-ADR, to be formalized)

- Router: React Router v7 data mode, `createHashRouter` (hash routing works identically in
  WebView2 custom protocol, `tauri://localhost`, and browser dev/preview) — ADR-001.
- Preview rendering boundary: connector returns bounded rendered page bitmaps for PDF/Office/
  AV thumbnails; UI decodes raw bytes only for image/hex/text (bounded) — ADR-003.
- Mock data strategy: procedural deterministic node space + typed-array aggregate index for
  1.2M nodes (filters scan typed arrays, never materialize full objects) — ADR-004.
- Skip the reference's monetization/retention/license-gate surfaces: they are commercial
  funnel specific to the reference product, not part of a truthful recovery-tool information
  architecture. Documented in UI-MAP as deliberate divergence.
- Product identity: neutral "Recovery Wizard" branding, original strings, original icons
  (Lucide interim base, documented in INTERIM-ASSETS.md).

### Next

T2 — VLM extraction across all 63 screenshots → SCREENSHOT-MANIFEST.md + VISUAL-SPEC.md draft;
T3 QSS cross-check; T4 UI-MAP.md; push gate docs.

---

## Session 1 continued — 2026-10-24 (build → verification → handoff)

### T5–T8 — Scaffold, tokens, primitives, connector (DONE)

- Versions verified live; ADR-005 records the three spec/registry conflicts
  (Vite 7 nonexistent → 8.3.5; TS 7 exists → kept spec-named 5.9.3; RR8/Vitest5
  exist → kept spec-named 7.18.4/4.1.12; RHF beta → 7.91.0; 3 packages repinned
  past the 24 h minimumReleaseAge policy).
- pnpm 12: build approvals via `allowBuilds` map in pnpm-workspace.yaml.
- Tailwind v4 four-step architecture (tokens.css → @theme inline → base).
- Connector: contract.ts (9 domains), mock (mulberry32-seeded; NodeSpace
  typed-array index for 1.2 M nodes with two-pass subtree aggregates),
  tauri stub, factory.

### T9–T17 — All feature surfaces (DONE)

Home (device cards, quick targets, session resume), ScanConfig (staged modes,
8 categories, advanced policies, zero-fill warning), ScanProgress (live 3-pane
results, gauge cluster, pause/stop/celebration, device-lost prompt), Results
(toolbar, filter bar, lazy tree, virtualized list, context menu, contextual
CTA), Preview (bounded kinds, worker hex, diagnostics), Recovery (destination
validation with hard overlap refusal, queue, report export), Health (SMART
table), Repair (REPAIR-typed consent, undo log), Settings (theme/density/
locale, diagnostics, about).

### T19 — Tests, enforcement, CI (DONE)

- 52 Vitest tests green (contract timing budgets asserted: cancel ≤300 ms,
  pause/resume <600 ms, filter <200 ms; determinism; injections; overlap
  refusal; repair consent round-trip).
- eslint recommendedTypeChecked + react-hooks v7 (compiler rules): 0 errors;
  external-store pattern (useSyncExternalStore) for progress streams.
- arch-lint + ast-grep + eslint zones: connector boundary clean (A1–A5).
- CI/ui-smoke/release workflows complete (windows-latest).

### Live verification (agent-browser, evidence screenshots verify-01..08)

Full golden path PASS with 0 page errors: home → select → config → scan →
completion modal → results (filter, tree, 200-row pages) → row select →
preview pane → recover → destination → job → report. Two real defects found
and fixed during verification:

1. Row checkbox double-toggle (span wrapper + Radix onCheckedChange both
   toggled) — root-caused via Radix source read; fixed in virtual-file-list.
2. RadioGroupItem used outside RadioGroup in DestinationRow — surfaced by
   the error boundary; replaced with a self-contained radio indicator.
   Also fixed: query-client thunk invocation in the scan progress store;
   one-shot disconnect injection; completed-scan sidebar cleanup.

### T20 — Docs, acceptance, handoff (DONE)

- docs/: CONNECTOR-CONTRACT, ARCHITECTURE, adr/001–005, TESTING, ROADMAP,
  INTERIM-ASSETS, VISUAL-ACCEPTANCE (55-grid), README, AUDIT-UI.
- Budget gates PASS: main 86/200 KB gzip, total 301/500 KB.

### Handoff — next session

Wire the real engine: implement RecoveryConnector in connector/tauri over
invoke()/emit, add Rust commands mirroring the contract, keep every UI file
untouched (factory swap via VITE_CONNECTOR=tauri). See docs/ROADMAP.md for
the full ordered list, including re-measuring the PARTIAL grid items on
Windows hardware.

---

## Session 2 — 2026-10-24 (CI red → green: full re-verification)

User report: release failing, all CI failing, "looks like incomplete fast
implementation — give more time and attention, verify all again."

### Diagnosis (from downloaded Actions logs)

Five failed runs, four distinct root causes:

1. **CI Format check**: Windows runners default `core.autocrlf=true` → the
   checkout rewrites every text file to CRLF → Prettier (endOfLine=lf) failed
   on 121 files at once. Typecheck/lint had PASSED before it; everything after
   (arch-lint, ast-grep, knip, jscpd, tests, build, cargo) never ran — the
   "all checks failing" impression was mostly this cascade.
2. **UI Smoke tauri-debug-build**: `tauri build --debug --bundles none` is
   invalid CLI (possible values msi/nsis) → `--no-bundle`.
3. **UI Smoke smoke**: Playwright strict-mode violation —
   `getByText(/internal drives/i)` matched both the sidebar nav item and the
   section heading → role-scoped locator.
4. **Release**: tag `v0.1.0-ui-mock` vs app version `0.1.0` mismatch → all
   three manifests bumped to `0.1.0-ui-mock` (the task-brief tag).
5. **knip would have failed anyway**: never ran, but found 60+ findings when
   run locally (dead code, misconfigured project globs).

### Fixes and completion work

- `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`, CRLF for .bat/.cmd/.ps1, binary
  marks) — makes Windows checkouts byte-stable.
- Completed the dangling `ScanParams.pathScope` feature (contract field was
  added but nothing consumed it):
  - NodeSpace: `resolveScope` (drive-prefix/case/separator normalization),
    per-scan Uint8Array dir mask threaded through query/count/trees/aggregates
    (state kept in ScanRuntime — the space instance is shared per volume);
    scoped path-tree presents the scanned folder as root; `suggestedScopePath`.
  - Mock connector: `scan-scope-invalid` hard error with reason key; scope-aware
    found-file curve via scoped stats; `pickDirectory(hint?)` roots at a volume
    (contract change, documented) and returns a folder that actually resolves.
  - UI: "Scan location" section in scan-config (whole drive vs folder, input +
    Browse + hint + disabled-Start guard); Home "Choose a folder…" passes
    `?folder=1`; i18n keys en/zh-CN (parity 398/398).
  - 3 new contract tests (invalid scope error; absolute+relative forms list
    only in-scope files; path-tree root) — suite now 55/55.
- **Real bug found & fixed (pre-existing)**: `/scan/:volumeId` routes (device-card
  volume links, choose-folder) failed with "device not found" — mock
  `getDeviceInfo` only resolved device ids. Now resolves volume → owning
  device, matching startScan semantics; contract doc updated.
- **Real bug found & fixed (pre-existing, dev-only)**: DevPanel rendered
  unconditionally — its Close button toggled a store flag nothing consumed.
  Panel now gated on `devPanelOpen`.
- Accessibility upgrade: the three scan-progress modals (stop confirm,
  celebration, device-lost) were hand-rolled `role="dialog"` divs without
  focus trap or Esc handling → rebuilt on Radix Dialog (device-lost is
  non-dismissable: reconnect is the only honest action). Live-verified: Esc
  closes stop-confirm, dialog names announced, zero console errors.
- Dead-code purge (knip → 0 findings): removed Stepper, Textarea,
  ScrollArea/Separator (scroll-area.tsx renamed skeleton.tsx — only Skeleton
  was consumed), tabs.tsx, 30+ unused re-exports/variants/helpers
  (expect/hashString/clamp, formatByteUnit, setLogLevel, EXTENSIONS,
  HomeStats, raw Tooltip/DropdownMenu re-exports); wired `exportLogText`
  into Settings→Diagnostics (was duplicated inline); wired Radix Select into
  scan-config sector size (was a native `<select>`). Dependencies removed:
  @radix-ui/react-{tabs,scroll-area,separator,slider,toggle-group},
  @testing-library/user-event.
- knip.json: tests tsx entry (was `tests/**/*.ts` — .tsx invisible), CSS in
  project (resolves tw-animate-css `@import`), `ignoreExportsUsedInFile`
  (router/ErrorScreen/ConnectorMode class of false positives);
  `src/connector/contract.ts` types stay via in-file usage — no ignores needed.
- CI hardening: `KNIP_DISABLE_RAW_TRANSFER=1` on the knip step (oxc raw
  transfer reserves a 6 GiB buffer per core — fragile on runners, and crashes
  this 4 GB sandbox outright).
- Rust clippy pre-fix: `format!("/select,{}", path)` → `{path}` inline
  (uninlined_format_args is warn-by-default; CI runs clippy -D warnings, and
  clippy had NEVER run — the format check blocked it). serde_json already
  removed from Cargo.toml matches the (serde-only) sources.

### Re-verification (local, sandbox-representable parts)

typecheck ✓ · eslint 0 errors (2 informational react-compiler notices on
RHF/TanStack APIs — inherent to spec'd libraries) · prettier ✓ · arch-lint ✓ ·
ast-grep both rules ✓ (negative-tested: injected violations are caught) ·
knip 0 findings ✓ · jscpd 0.42% ✓ · vitest 55/55 ✓ · build ✓ · bundle budget
89.7/200 KB main, 315.2/500 KB total ✓ · i18n parity 398/398 ✓ ·
agent-browser live pass: choose-folder → folder-mode preselect → Browse fills a
resolvable path → scoped scan → completion dialog → scoped results (Config as
tree root) → stop-confirm Esc/Keep/Stop — zero console errors, evidence
screenshots verify2-01..05.

Windows-only gates (NSIS, cargo, Playwright-on-Windows, DPI) re-armed on the
tagged commit via Release/UI-Smoke/CI runs.

### Session 2 continuation — Windows-only landmines (found by the relaunched CI)

The relaunch surfaced defects that no Linux-side check could catch:

6. **arch-lint/bundle-check Windows path bug**: `new URL('..').pathname`
   keeps a leading `/` before the drive letter on Windows; `path.join` then
   resolves the phantom `D:\D:\a\...` root → ENOENT. Fixed with
   `fileURLToPath`. (First CI run where arch-lint ever executed.)
7. **Rust compile errors** (first cargo run ever): `std::env::consts::os/arch/
family` don't exist — the constants are `OS/ARCH/FAMILY`. Fixed.
8. **e2e spec was never runnable** (written blind, browsers unavailable in the
   sandbox): three more strict-mode/phantom locators — `/search for lost
data/i` matches 3 buttons (cards + CTA) → `.first()`; the filter "Type"
   option group renders only AFTER expanding the Type dropdown (added the
   click); `/recovery condition/i` matched nothing (assert the preview pane's
   confidence badge instead, scoped to the complementary region).
9. **Cross-effect regression caught by re-verification**: the scope-suggested
   pickDirectory change made destination Browse propose a SOURCE-volume folder
   → hard overlap refusal. Contract fix: `pickDirectory(hint)` now also takes
   `excludeDeviceId`; the recovery page passes the scan target so the mock
   suggests a different device (regression test added).
10. **Celebration modal auto-redirected after 1.2 s** — the completion surface
    was effectively un-interactable (and un-testable); removed per corpus
    (explicit CTA only).
11. Live agent-browser re-verification of the FULL golden path on the fixed
    build: persistent completion modal → results → filter/search → row click
    updates preview → checkbox selects → Recover 1 item → Browse suggests
    D:\Recovered Files → report. Zero console errors (verify2-06).

### Final state

CI ✅ and UI Smoke ✅ on d90a8d0 (Windows runner: typecheck, lint, format,
arch-lint, ast-grep, knip, jscpd, 56/56 tests, build, bundle budget, cargo
check, clippy, Playwright golden path, Tauri debug build). Tag
v0.1.0-ui-mock on d90a8d0 → Release SUCCEEDED: unsigned NSIS installer
(Recovery.Wizard_0.1.0-ui-mock_x64-setup.exe, 1.4 MB) + SHA-256 checksum
published to GitHub Releases. main HEAD c0b6ec6 also green (CI + UI Smoke).

---

## Session 3 — 2026-10-24 (Audit & completion against reference; theme adoption; lost-data flow correction)

### T1 — Baseline (DONE)

- Cloned fresh: research corpus at /home/z/my-project/research-corpus (11,495
  files), app at /home/z/my-project/app (147 tracked files, HEAD 90a24f9).
- Baseline: main green (CI + UI Smoke on c0b6ec6; 90a24f9 worklog-only).
- Session prompt saved (token redated → redacted) to worklog/session-audit-prompt.md.
- Session goals: (a) full corpus re-read incl. VLM on all 63 screenshots;
  (b) full app read; (c) AUDIT-REPORT.md; (d) theme adoption from the two
  diskgenie-v2 raw files as visual identity source of truth; (e) correct the
  lost-data flow (remove invented ScanConfig intermediate step — reference
  goes device → scan directly, quick→deep automatic); (f) mock API
  improvements per architecture docs only; (g) full quality grid.

### T2–T4 — Corpus re-read, app read, audit (DONE)

- Full corpus pass: all 9 architecture docs; UIUX artifacts 01–35 + dynamic
  ground-truth set (deep-read via structured extraction agents with per-claim
  citations; key docs read directly: 00-INDEX, 04-recovery-workflow,
  07-user-flow-uiux, 04-userflow-state-machine, 08-scan-phase-deep-dive,
  dynamic-ground-truth--scan-phase-captured, 35-redesign-reference-atlas,
  06-dialog-telemetry, 17-monetization). VLM extraction running over all 63
  screenshots → docs/evidence/vlm/*.json (structured per-area prompts).
- App read: every source file, test, workflow, config (bulk-read agent + direct
  reads of router/home/scan-config/scan-progress/contract/mock head).
- docs/AUDIT-REPORT.md written and pushed BEFORE any fix: 13 axis verdicts,
  6 behavior findings (critical: invented scan-config step — three independent
  corpus proofs cited), 55-item slop list, per-surface verdicts, fix order.
- Theme sources fetched (only the two raw files): theme-sources/themes.ts (113
  lines) + tokens.css (427 lines). 5 palettes, two-layer data-theme/data-scheme.

### Key corpus findings driving this session

- Lost-data flow: scanClickedSlot → CDetailPage directly, scan starts on page
  flip; quick pass (~21 s) → advanced pass AUTOMATIC (sigQuickScanFinished ×2 →
  onQuickScanCompleted; runtime m_iScanType 3→4 back-to-back). NO config screen
  exists anywhere in tr sites/telemetry/connect-edges/QSS. CQuickScanCompleteWnd
  is a Free-tier upsell surface (out of scope per UI-MAP §0), not a gate.
- Status-line formats (verbatim): "Quick Scanning%1, Files Found:" /
  "Advanced Scanning , Files Found: N (size)" / "Scan Completed, Files Found:
  N (size)" / "Remaining time: 07m43s | Reading sector: X/Y" / bottom full-width
  "Searching: <path>" strip.
- Engine scan setup is automatic (FS probe → quick searcher; advanced = full
  searcher set + RAW carver; sector size default 512) — no user-facing params.

### T5 — Theme adoption (DONE)

- Fetched ONLY the two designated raw files; verbatim copies committed at
  src/theme/adopted/{themes.ts,tokens.css} (byte-identical, verified).
- New architecture: adopted raw (immutable, knip-excluded) → semantic
  mapping (src/styles/tokens.css rewritten: app names ← adopted names) →
  Tailwind @theme inline. dark: variant now [data-scheme="dark"].
- 5 palettes + system + derived HC; ThemeProvider reworked on the adopted
  applyThemeAttributes(); title-bar quick menu + Settings updated; About
  dialog implemented (was a placeholder toast).
- A11y-driven mapping choices with MEASURED ratios (VISUAL-SPEC §A11):
  text-grade accent #cc3d15 (4.95:1) vs source ink (2.80:1); status text
  derivatives 5.0-5.4:1; focus ring solid (source 2.9:1); brand CTA keeps
  the adopted gradient+glow as the documented exception; HC = derived layer.
- Found + fixed two real CSS hazards: (a) header comment containing `*/`
  inside "dur-_/ease-_" prematurely closed the comment and silently dropped
  the whole first token rule from the build; (b) same-name var() forwards
  (--border: var(--border)) are self-references resolving to fallback —
  pass-through names are no longer redeclared.
- Tests: tests/theme-snapshot.test.ts (block+value fixture pin, palette
  registry, semantic-layer reference validity) + tests/i18n-parity.test.ts
  (en⇄zh-CN key-surface, empty-value, placeholder parity) — 10 new tests
  green. Browser-verified all 5 palettes + HC (computed tokens + VLM
  critique, grade A-).
- ADR-007 written.

### T6 — Lost-data flow correction (DONE — the critical behavioral fix)

Corpus evidence (three independent sources): scanClickedSlot decode (artifact
04 §4: stack flips directly to CDetailPage, scan starts immediately); dynamic
ground-truth (click → scan-phase view, quick pass ~21 s then "Advanced
Scanning 9%" with NO user action); runtime wiring (sigQuickScanFinished ×2 →
onQuickScanCompleted; m_iScanType 3→4 back-to-back). NO config screen exists
in the 2,402 tr sites / 195 telemetry events / 722 connect edges / QSS.

- DELETED src/features/scan-configuration (526 lines) + /scan/:deviceId route
  - its i18n section (categories moved to top level).
- Home: "Search for Lost Data" CTA, card scan buttons, volume links, Recycle
  Bin / Desktop / Choose-folder quick targets ALL start scans directly and
  navigate to /scan/:id/live. Recycle Bin + Desktop are real virtual targets
  in the fixtures (kind: virtual, no letter/mount; excluded from
  health/repair pickers). Choose-folder: picker first, then start.
- Contract (ADR-008): ScanParams = { targetId, pathScope? } (mode/
  categories/sectorSize/badSectorPolicy/retries removed — engine-internal
  per architecture/04 §3); ScanPhase + scanPhaseOf; ScanProgressEvent.
  currentPath (the "Searching:" ticker); RecoverySelection (nodes | all
  - filter); preview kind decided by the connector; SessionMeta.mode,
    deleteSession, ResultsFilter.confidence removed; hideEmptyFiles added;
    MountPoint + RecoveryReport.processedTotal/truncatedItemLists added.
- Mock: single automatic stage chain (quick→advanced, quick collapsed when
  !quickScanAvailable); searchingPathAt ticker; recover-all = REAL lazy job
  (lookahead materialization, batch ticks, cursor — 340k-file job completes
  in ~30 s); lost-path origins generated (weighted 62/26/12); failing-disk
  scenario → health 'bad'; validateDestination accepts device OR volume id;
  capacity-budgeted found-size scaling (corpus: 147 GB on 149 GB disk).
- REAL BUGS FOUND LIVE: spaceFor fell back to the FIRST device's NodeSpace
  for device-id targets (D: scans returned C:'s file counts) — fixed with
  proper resolveTarget mapping; recover-all ETA was per-item (160 h at
  scale) — now batch-cadence derived.
- ScanProgressPage rebuilt per atlas §6/GT-scan: bottom cluster with corpus
  status lines ("Quick/Advanced scanning X%" + "Files found: N (size)" +
  "Remaining time" + "Reading sector: X/Y"), full-width "Searching:" ticker,
  real used-time (engine startedAt; 1 s ticker, purity-safe), celebration
  with 3 stats + "Go to Recover", no-Esc dismiss per corpus.
- ResultsExplorer: Preview context item previews the single-selected/active
  row; Smart select = best-per-name confidence-ranked selection (corpus
  magic wand); select-all = tri-state over the FULL filtered count (all-mode
  - exclusions in the selection store); icons view = real tile renderer
    (thumbnails, 2-line names, hover checkbox); search breadcrumb "Search
    results for …"; preview-pane drag resizer (corpus splitter); Open-location
    disabled in mock with truthful reason.
- FilterBar: corpus toggles (Existing files / Hide 0 KB) + Custom type
  suffix entry ("*.doc; *.xlsx"); shared Checkbox/RadioGroup components
  (no raw inputs); correct aria-labels on size inputs.
- Recovery page: source-device validation fix (audit 2.6 — the scanId bug);
  neededBytes from scan-state averages; recover-all through the selection
  contract; queue show-more; report uses processedTotal + truncation notice.
- Dedupe: hex formatter unified in lib/hex-format (worker + fallback);
  MetaList; rowSelected/LoaderRow; usePhysicalDevices hook (health/repair);
  sysVolumeFixture; jscpd → 0 clones (vendored theme excluded).
- Removed dead deps: react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers, zod,
  @radix-ui/react-select (+ vendor-forms chunk); select.tsx; useDeviceInfo;
  PreviewKind export.
- Tests: connector suite rewritten for the new contract + new coverage
  (direct-start chain order, quick→advanced automatic phases, collapsed
  quick pass, ticker stage-gating, location targets, lost-path origins,
  hide-empty filter, connector-owned preview kinds, recover-all real job
  with exact counts + bounded lists, device/volume overlap refusal,
  failing-disk health, openPath honesty). 81 unit tests green; e2e golden
  path rewritten (direct start asserted) + new quick-target test.
- Live-verified in browser: direct start (device → scan in one click),
  quick→advanced automatic with corpus status formats, completion modal
  with real stats, results 3-pane, select-all 340000, recover-all running
  65311/340000 at 20% then completing with report. VLM critique of results
  screen: clean 3-pane, aligned columns, no defects.

### Follow-up verification fixes

- Added an inline original SVG favicon so the production preview does not
  request a missing `/favicon.ico` and fail the console-error smoke gate.
- Corrected `formatBytes` to retain one fractional digit for all non-byte
  units. The corpus-parity formatter test now renders a 149.45 GiB volume as
  `149.5 GB`, rather than silently truncating it to `149 GB`.

## Session 4 — 2026-10-24 (Audit verification, theme completion, localization, accessibility, acceptance, release)

### Session model note

Two parallel sessions worked this mandate concurrently. The remote session
executed T5–T11 (its commits 811d328 → f9df1c8 landed first, verified green);
this session had independently produced its own T5 on a local branch — that
variant was preserved on `session4-t5-parallel` and the remote chain adopted
per the pull-frequently/never-force-push rule. This session's unique
contributions then continued on top: corpus verification of the parallel
chain, VLM evidence completion, T12–T13, T17–T20.

### T1 — Baseline — DONE

Fresh clones; CI on the audit commit was RED at Format check — prettier
normalized (24aabf0) and main restored to green before any feature work.
Prompt archived (token redacted) at worklog/session-4-audit-prompt.md.

### T2 — Corpus pass — DONE

- Direct reads: architecture 00/04/05u/07, artifacts 01/02/04/05/07/08/09/
  10/11/14/21/31/35, GT-scan-phase, CORRECTIONS.md.
- Two extraction agents (2-a: 29 artifact/arch docs; 2-b: raw string tables,
  telemetry census, config values, themdark palette slots) — full structured
  reports with line citations.
- VLM: all 63 screenshots extracted (docs/evidence/vlm/shots/ — checkpointed
  foreground driver; the sandbox reaps background processes ~1 min after the
  launching call — root-caused, documented, worked around with budgeted
  foreground chunks).

### T3–T4 — App read + audit verification — DONE

Every source file read directly or via the inventory agent (usage maps, slop
scan, i18n key inventory). The parallel session's T5–T11 chain was verified
against this session's independent corpus knowledge: the flow correction
(direct start, quick→advanced automatic, corpus status lines, no-Esc
celebration, real elapsed time, stop-confirm, device-lost) matches artifact
04 §4, GT-scan §2/§7/§8, atlas §6, artifact 08 §3 on every checked point.

### T12 — Localization to the exact-referenced surface — DONE

- Found + fixed 16 REFERENCED-BUT-MISSING keys (raw-key render bugs): new
  about.* namespace (AboutDialog shipped with 11 unresolvable keys),
  repair.finding.* (finding descriptions), repair.consentRequired,
  results.status.countOnly reference typo.
- Purged 102 dead keys from BOTH catalogs; plural-pair semantics fixed
  (X/X_other is one i18next entry — the first prune over-deleted 5 pairs,
  restored + regression-guarded).
- audit §3.43 concatenation fixed properly (repair.appliedCount/
  rolledBackCount interpolation); dialog Close aria-label i18n'd.
- Governance: scripts/i18n-sweep.mjs + tests/i18n-sweep.test.ts —
  missing = 0 AND unused = 0, enforced in CI. Settings gained the full
  7-mode theme picker (ember/tide/blossom were unreachable from Settings)
  and the corpus-backed Scale control (100/150/200%, reference DPI menu).
- Wired the two reference-backed states that had keys but no UI: results
  partial-state banner (with honest search-again preserving pathScope) and
  the recovery cancel-confirm (CScanCommonPopDlg family).

### T13 — Accessibility — DONE (axe: 0 violations)

Live production-build audit (agent-browser + axe-core 4.10) with full
evidence in docs/evidence/a11y/:

- nested-interactive: DeviceCard radio restructured (actions are siblings).
- Light-family text-grade accent re-derived: #b83410 (the previous #cc3d15
  failed on ink-soft tints — badges 4.36:1, active sidebar 3.98:1);
  warning grade #a84c07; focus rings follow.
- Dark-family status text-grades fixed (light derivatives leaked: success
  2.74:1 on dark) — scheme maps to adopted vivid hues, danger lifted to
  #ff8085; neutral-dark accent lifted to #ff9d85 (raw coral failed on its
  own tint); ember/tide verified passing; blossom cream-grade success.
- Meaningful text moved off the disabled tier (sidebar headers, tree
  counts, preview placeholder).
- Grid ARIA completed (columnheader + aria-sort, rowgroup, gridcell,
  presentation loaders); separator resizer got valuenow/min/max + i18n
  label; icon-only radios named; breadcrumb carries the level-1 heading.
- Pulse discipline: liveness animations moved to dots — animating TEXT
  opacity transiently breaks contrast (axe caught a badge at 1.84:1
  mid-pulse).
- Final: 0 violations across home ×6 states (5 palettes + HC) + scan +
  results; keyboard walkthrough recorded; zero console/page errors.

### T15 — Perf gates — DONE (re-measured)

Bundle 89.4/200 KB main, 273.5/500 KB total (down from 315.7 — dead deps +
purged surface); filter <200 ms asserted on the 340k space; jscpd 0 clones;
knip 0 findings (the one-shot prune tool removed after use).

### T17 — ACCEPTANCE.md — DONE

Per-surface 55-grid verdicts with evidence; every surface PASS; 3 PARTIALs
tracked with precise Windows-hardware rationale (cold start, fractional-DPI
capture, RTL as documented non-goal).

### T18 — Docs sweep — DONE

AUDIT-REPORT §7 resolution table (no open rows); README current; TESTING
--no-bundle fix; SCREENSHOT-MANIFEST VLM index; ROADMAP session-4 section;
ADR-005 RHF row updated (dep removed in ADR-008).

### T19 — Release — DONE

v0.2.0: three manifests bumped in lockstep; app version now flows from
package.json (tree-shaken named import) instead of a hardcoded literal;
tag v0.2.0 pushed → Release workflow (unsigned NSIS + SHA-256, notes state
signing pending).

### Handoff — next actions

1. Engine-integration session per ROADMAP (wire connector/tauri over
   invoke(); delete the loud stub; engine Rust commands; real destination
   validation; re-measure grid #34–44 on real hardware).
2. Windows-hardware measurements for the three tracked PARTIALs in
   docs/ACCEPTANCE.md (cold start number, 125/175% DPI capture matrix).
3. Interim assets per docs/INTERIM-ASSETS.md (Lucide → purpose-drawn v2).

## Session 4 continuation — 2026-10-24 (parallel-push reconciliation + sweep hardening + v0.2.1)

### Context

Picked up from c584524 (VLM extraction complete). While this session diagnosed
the failing CI (runs 40091335090..40093467405), a parallel session pushed the
rest of T13–T20 (axe-zero accessibility, ACCEPTANCE grid, docs sweep, release
v0.2.0, worklog handoff) plus its own restore of the same two purged i18n keys
(ae5fe4c). Rebased on top — never force-push; reconciled both directions.

### Root cause of the CI/Smoke failures (independently re-diagnosed)

`scripts/i18n-prune.mjs` (one-shot T12 tool) could not see ternary key
literals inside t() calls that contain nested parens:
`t(phase === 'quick' ? 'scan.quickScanning' : 'scan.advancedScanning',
formatPercent(...))`. Both keys were reported unused → purged from BOTH
catalogs (d0dac17) → the live scan status line rendered raw keys → Windows
UI-Smoke failed on /quick scanning|advanced scanning/i at both spec sites;
knip failed on the orphaned prune script itself.

### Reconciliation with ae5fe4c (the parallel fix)

- Catalogs: ONE canonical pair, corpus-verbatim — 'Quick scanning
  {{percent}}' / 'Advanced scanning {{percent}}' (en), 快速扫描/高级扫描
  (zh). ae5fe4c's en value said 'Advanced searching' (transcription slip:
  contradicts its own commit message's corpus citation, and /advanced
  scanning/i can never match it). Verified live: Quick scanning 0.9% →
  Advanced scanning 20% → 77.9% through the automatic phase chain.
- Sweep: kept their NAMESPACES over-approximation (never-prune-a-live-key
  safety net) AND added the precise paren-balanced t() extraction
  (tCalls + firstArgKeyLiterals) + real-domain family resolution
  (ConfidenceGrade/CollisionPolicy/FileCategoryId unions from contract.ts);
  unknown template prefixes resolving to zero defined keys now report as
  missing families instead of passing silently.
- Real latent bug found by the precise extractor: results-tree type-mode
  category nodes still addressed the deleted scanConfig.categories.*
  namespace — raw-key render on the By-type tree, outside e2e reach. Fixed
  to categories.* (contract union). Live-verified: 'Photos & images | Videos
  | Audio | Documents | Email | Archives | Bookmarks | Everything else'.
- Regression pin: tests/i18n-sweep-extraction.test.ts (3 tests, the exact
  nested-paren ternary shape). Suite now 86/86.

### Verification on the merged tree (ea1fd44)

tsc ✓ · eslint 0 errors · prettier ✓ · arch-lint ✓ · ast-grep both rules ✓ ·
knip 0 · jscpd 0.00% · vitest 86/86 · build 89.4/200 KB main,
273.5/500 KB total · sweep 332 defined / 0 unused / 0 missing · live
golden path on the production build: restructured DeviceCard (radio name no
longer nests the scan buttons — axe fix intact), direct start, both phase
strings, completion modal → results → type tree, zero console/page errors.

### v0.2.1 (patch release)

v0.2.0 was tagged at 2ae9ee4 — BEFORE the key restore — so the published
installer renders raw i18n keys in the scan status line (its own UI-Smoke
run failed). Cutting v0.2.1 from the reconciled HEAD with the fix;
release notes state signing pending (unsigned builds).

### Next

1. Watch CI + UI-Smoke green on ea1fd44, Release succeed on v0.2.1.
2. Handoff items unchanged: engine-integration session per ROADMAP; the
   three Windows-hardware PARTIALs in docs/ACCEPTANCE.md; interim assets
   (Lucide → purpose-drawn v2).

## Session 5 — 2026-10-24 (Experience-layer craftsman session)

### T1 — Baseline, prompt archive, sync — DONE

- Synced local main to origin/main `8ab7234` (v0.2.1). Parallel audit
  sessions 3–4 already landed: theme tokens (ADR-007), lost-data flow
  correction (ADR-008), VLM extraction of all 63 corpus screenshots,
  localization governance, axe-clean palettes, releases v0.2.0/v0.2.1.
- Remote CI/UI-Smoke/Release all green at 8ab7234 (API check, runs
  40097715450/40097713739/40097713674).
- Re-cloned research corpus (11,495 files) to
  `/home/z/my-project/repos/easeus-drw-research`.
- Archived this session's prompt (token redacted) to
  `worklog/session-experience-prompt.md`; read twice before starting.
- This session owns: motion, dialogs/popups, custom window chrome,
  collapsible sidebar, responsiveness/DPI, per-component verification,
  plus completion of any missing feature surfaces. Gate docs before any
  experience change: EXPERIENCE-SPEC / MOTION-SPEC / IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS /
  INTERIM-ASSETS.

### Session-4 continuation — final record

- CI/UI-Smoke/Release on v0.2.1 (8ab7234): all green on Windows
  (runs 40097715450 / 40097713739 / 40097713674 — release artifacts:
  Recovery.Wizard_0.2.1_x64-setup.exe + SHA-256, notes state signing
  pending). ea1fd44 also green — the reconciliation fix verified on the
  full Windows gate.
- Cast-removal pass (70b2d17): the last two `as unknown as` casts
  replaced with typed boundaries (connector factory returns the concrete
  mock instance; worker global declared as DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope).
  Hex preview verified live through the worker on the production build.
- Format-gate rescue: session-5's baseline committed its prompt archive
  without prettier (the 24aabf0 failure class repeating) — normalized;
  CI green restored.
- Session-4 audit mandate closed: no open MISMATCH rows in AUDIT-REPORT
  §7; ACCEPTANCE per-surface PASS with three Windows-hardware PARTIALs
  tracked; v0.2.0's raw-key installer defect patched by v0.2.1; the i18n
  sweep now structurally incapable of the ternary blind spot (extraction
  pin + family domains + missing-family flagging + over-approximation
  net).

---

### T2–T4 — Corpus full-read, app full-read, gate docs — DONE

- Corpus read: architecture docs (00/04/05-uiux/07), UIUX artifacts 35
  (atlas — complete), 16 (shell/chrome), 21 (QSS state census), plus
  VLM JSONs (splash, hamburger, paused, midtransition, celebration,
  destination) and the 63-shot README. RE evidence: chrome SVG 4-state
  fills extracted (light #616777/#D3DCE7/#0560FD/#1A1A1A/#A0A6B1; dark
  #B0B5C0/#323D4C/#F1F5FF/#5094FF), QSS pseudo-state census
  (hover 224 / pressed 195 / disabled 147 — no transition property in
  2,805 rules), QPropertyAnimation/QEasingCurve imports (18) → motion
  philosophy: instant swaps + sparse fades + live progress.
- App read: all experience-relevant sources (shell, router, dialog,
  toaster, button, progress, menus, ui-store, theme, scan-progress,
  results-explorer, filter-bar, home) + structured scan of the rest.
  Baseline verified: tsc clean, 86/86 tests.
- Gap analysis → gate docs pushed: docs/EXPERIENCE-SPEC.md,
  docs/MOTION-SPEC.md, docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md,
  docs/INTERIM-ASSETS.md (corpus-extraction layer added).
- Working order confirmed: T5 chrome → T6 sidebar → T7 dialogs → …

### T5 — Custom window chrome — DONE

- Corpus-extracted the 4-state chrome SVGs (min/max/restore/close ×
  nor/hov/pre/dis × light/dark = 32 files) into
  `src/assets/interim/chrome/` + `manifest.json` (INTERIM-ASSETS §A layer;
  extraction script persisted at scripts/extract-chrome-assets.mjs in the
  workspace, not the repo).
- `WindowControls` component (components/ui/window-controls.tsx): corpus
  order min→max/restore→close, 24×24 corpus glyphs (hover plate rx4 baked
  in), instant nor/hov/pre swaps (ART21: Qt QSS has no transitions),
  live maximize/restore glyph via debounced onResized→isMaximized, i18n
  aria-labels (chrome.* in en+zh), 32×32 hit areas, focus-visible ring.
- Browser truthfulness: the cluster renders ONLY in the Tauri runtime
  (lib/runtime.ts gate) — browser/Playwright get host chrome, no dead
  buttons. Live-verified: controls null, header present, dblclick inert,
  zero console errors (download/t5-browser-mode.png).
- Shell: title-bar dblclick toggles maximize (Tauri-only, ignored over
  interactive children).
- Capabilities: +core:window:{minimize,toggle-maximize,is-maximized,close,
  start-dragging} (compile-time validated by the tauri-debug-build gate).
- knip: @tauri-apps/api ignore removed (now genuinely imported); SVGs
  inline as data URIs in the bundle (both palette fills verified in dist).
- Gates: tsc ✓, eslint 0 err (1 pre-existing compiler warning), prettier ✓,
  arch-lint ✓, ast-grep ✓, knip 0 ✓, jscpd 0.00% ✓, vitest 91/91 (5 new),
  build ✓ 96.6/200 KB main. e2e: +browser-mode chrome test.

### T6 — Collapsible left sidebar — DONE

- ui-store: sidebarCollapsed + toggleSidebar/setSidebarCollapsed with
  localStorage persistence (rw.ui.sidebarCollapsed), matching the
  theme/density persistence pattern.
- Shell sidebar: 52px collapsed icon rail; width transition var(--dur-slow)
  360ms ease-in-out; label/section fade var(--dur-fast) 160ms; icons keep
  their 18px gutter so they land centered on the collapsed rail (no
  re-animation); overflow-x hidden during transition; title attribute on
  collapsed links (hover discovery) while labels stay in the a11y tree.
- Toggle: real button (Tab-reachable) with aria-expanded/aria-controls and
  i18n'd labels (sidebar.collapse/expand, en+zh); PanelLeft icons.
- Reduced motion: global media query collapses both transitions to instant.
- Verified live on the production build: 208→52px, labels opacity 0 with
  icons retained, persistence across reload, keyboard expand (focus+Enter),
  zero console errors. Evidence: download/t6-sidebar-collapsed*.png.
- Tests: 5 new jsdom (aria wiring, collapse geometry, persistence
  round-trip, title affordance, same-DOM-node no-shift) + e2e sidebar
  spec (width/opacity/persistence/keyboard). Suite 96/96. Gates: tsc ✓,
  eslint 0 err, prettier ✓, arch-lint ✓, bundle 97.3/200 KB.

### T7 — Dialogs & popups: exit choreography + corpus audit — DONE

- Exit fades: `animate-fade-out` (var(--dur-base), ease-in) bound via
  data-[state=closed] on Dialog overlay + content, DropdownMenu,
  ContextMenu, Popover, and Tooltip; Radix Presence holds the tree until
  the animation ends (verified in built CSS + live).
- Outside-click swallow (corpus atlas §12 rule 10): baked into the shared
  DialogContent as the default — every modal (stop-confirm, destination,
  cancel-confirm, about, insufficient-space) now blocks click-through;
  call sites keep their explicit handlers (device-lost also blocks ESC;
  celebration blocks ESC per corpus).
- Focus choreography BUG found and fixed: Radix's default close-focus
  targets `triggerRef.current` — null for controlled dialogs opened
  without DialogTrigger, so focus fell to BODY on every close. Our
  DialogContent now captures the invoking element at open-auto-focus
  (StrictMode-safe containment guard) and restores it at close-auto-focus.
  Evidence: Playwright e2e (About → ESC → focused) + jsdom test; live
  instrumentation confirmed the missing focus call before the fix.
- Tests: +4 jsdom (enter/exit classes, outside swallow, ESC, focus
  return) + e2e dialog spec. Suite 100/100; e2e 6/6 locally; gates:
  tsc ✓ eslint 0 prettier ✓ arch-lint ✓ knip 0 jscpd 0.

### T8 — Toasts & notifications — DONE

- Repositioned the stack top-right BELOW the custom title bar
  (offset-top 48px = 36px title bar + 12px gap; corpus VLM placement of
  the results-phase toast) — clears the bottom-right Recover CTA
  (parameter 6: no overlap with persistent surfaces).
- Explicit duration 4000ms; gap 8; token-bound styling unchanged.
- Live-verified on the production build: container fixed at top-right
  (offsets via --offset-top/right), toast visible on fire, auto-dismiss
  at 4 s, HOVER-PAUSE proven (mouseenter dispatch → toast survived 6 s+),
  aria-live polite. Evidence: download/t8-toast-topright.png.
- jsdom test pins the placement semantics (lazy container mount quirk
  documented). Suite 101 tests total.

### T9 — Page transitions — DONE

- Route-change fade: `.route-fade` (fade-in var(--dur-fast) ease-out,
  opacity-only so the layout box is stable — zero CLS by construction),
  keyed by pathname in the shell (query-string changes never remount).
  Corpus note: QStackedWidget swaps instantly — the 160ms fade is the
  documented ESTIMATED premium refinement (MOTION-SPEC §3.4).
- Live-verified on the production build: animationName fade-in,
  0.16s duration, --ease-out curve, home→health remount, zero console
  errors.
- Type⇄Path tab switch verified as already corpus-aligned: Segmented
  highlights instantly, the tree rebuilds through skeleton rows (async
  query), matching the mid-transition capture.
- Reduced motion: global media query collapses the fade to instant.
- Tests: +2 jsdom (fade wrapper present; pathname-vs-query remount
  semantics). e2e 6/6 still green.

### T10 — Microinteractions — DONE

- Applied the adopted press tokens to the toggle primitives (spec §14):
  checkbox + radio `active:scale-[var(--press-scale)]` (0.985, with
  transition-[colors,transform]); segmented options
  `active:opacity-[var(--press-opacity)]` (0.75). State flips stay
  immediate (Qt-swap parity) — the press layer is purely tactile.
- Switch: thumb transform transition is the feedback (corpus-aligned; no
  invented press art). Drag-resizer follows the pointer 1:1 (no animation,
  verified in T3 read). Drag-and-drop: not evidenced in the corpus
  recovery-core — N/A (not invented).
- Search-removal chip (breadcrumb ✕): transition-colors + hover/press tint
  - focus ring.
- Tests: +3 jsdom press-state assertions. e2e 6/6; bundle 97.7/200 KB.

### T11 — State surfaces — DONE (bug found + fixed)

- Live verification via the dev panel exposed a real gap: the mock's
  permission-denied scenario marks VOLUME C:'s status, but the home page
  read device-level status only — the permission state never rendered.
- Fixed: home-page banners + DeviceCard lock/offline/health now read
  device OR volume status; per-volume scan chips are disabled (with
  truthful title) when that volume is permission-denied/disconnected while
  sibling volumes stay live; the device Scan button stays disabled only
  when the whole device is affected.
- Dev panel: scenario change now invalidates all queries (the scenario
  reshapes the whole mock world — the stale-cache confusion that hid this
  bug is gone).
- Verified live: banner "administrator approval" + 2 lock icons on the
  dev server (download/t11-permission-live.png); 3 regression tests
  (volume-level banner ×2, chip gating). Gauge pause-freeze verified
  structurally (progress stops → dashoffset static). Suite 109/109,
  e2e 6/6.
