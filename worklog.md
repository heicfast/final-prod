# final-prod — Unified Product Worklog

Session log for the unified repository (engine + ui + driver + installer).
Created by the consolidation session on 2026-10-26 from:
- core_recovery @ a574ecf6cc06a374e1ee0f893e574efef4904639 (main)
- recovery-wizard-ui-new @ f4a8f8aebab625e9048d833cd9c3501741d7c436 (v3)
- rda-driver @ da7efb9e0c94046893c62b25695bb95edf519f8b (main)

This file records the product's ongoing session history. Component-local
history lives in engine/worklog.md, ui/worklog.md, driver/worklog.md
(preserved verbatim from the source repositories at merge time).

## 2026-10-26T11:40Z — engine/ advanced to core_recovery@5ddccd8 (latest main)

A parallel integration lane (same mandate, same sources) had already
pushed the T3–T6 state to `origin/main` (gate plan, context sheets,
three history-preserving component merges, contracts/, build entry
points). Per the mandate's coordination rules (pull frequently, never
force-push, leave main green) that state is adopted as canonical and
this lane builds on it. Convergence audit between the two lanes' plans:
both independently pinned the driver service name to `rda`/`RDA` (the
core hard-codes `\\.\RDA`), the same in-process cr_ui FFI bridge
architecture, ProgramData shared state, surfaced consent-gated driver
step, and MSIX exclusion.

This merge advances `engine/` from a574ecf to the latest core main
(5ddccd8, pushed 2026-10-26T10:31Z — after the adoption merge was cut):
a8a189e (rrecov/cr_ui Windows link fix + the new one-entry
cr_ui_exports.def), 7a76c86 (cr_ui_tests static core on MSVC), 5ddccd8
(Win7 import-allowlist for the S-014/S-010/M-033 wave). Verified before
merge: `engine/include/cr/cr_ui.h` unchanged — the 78-export ABI v2
surface the bridge targets is identical. Verified after merge:
`git diff core@5ddccd8 HEAD:engine` is empty except the deliberate
post-adoption `.github` removal (4 inert workflows). Rewritten
histories share ancestor a0405e83; full lineage preserved (repo now
1107 commits).

## 2026-10-26T12:00Z — T11 installer + T12 MSIX verdict (integration lane)

`installer/` lands: `recoverywizard.nsi` (the combined product installer —
517 lines) + `portable.ps1` (the no-driver portable zip) + `README.md`
(design + deviations). `docs/MSIX-ASSESSMENT.md` records the T12 verdict:
MSIX is structurally impossible for this product (no kernel-driver
installation, no elevated full-trust in AppContainer) — dropped truthfully,
NSIS is the single distribution artifact.

Architecture resolution (recorded in installer/README.md): the ratified plan
§7.2 sketched a custom Tauri NSIS template, but the committed build.ps1 (T6)
defines a wrapper contract — outer product installer consuming the stock
Tauri bundle silently. The committed code wins: the wrapper is implemented
(avoiding Tauri-template version lock-in; all product concerns in one
reviewable script; contradiction documented).

Key behaviors: dual-mode install (MultiUser; per-user installs force the
driver off with a truthful read-only note — machine-level component);
surfaced driver page with the full explanation (what it does, what happens
without it, SYSTEM/admin DACL reality, UNSIGNED truth, add/remove later
anytime) whose checkbox is the consent control (default ON, synced with the
components page); engine kit gated at install (cr_ui.dll + >=1 runtime DLL —
the 0xc0000135 guard); driver registration via the driver's own install.ps1
(exact SCM args, service `RDA`, Parameters DWORDs) with update semantics
(stop+delete+recreate, no reboot) and non-fatal start failure surfacing the
signing guidance; ProgramData `HeicFast\Recovery Wizard\{sessions,logs}`
(constants from contracts/README.md); inner Tauri uninstall-key takeover ->
ONE complete Add/Remove entry; uninstall order: ask-close -> driver teardown
(uninstall.ps1 + fallback) -> ProgramData sessions KEPT by default (explicit
consent to delete) -> inner uninstaller silent -> engine/driver dirs ->
registry -> RMDir.

Validation (evidence: docs/INTEGRATION-VALIDATION/installer-compile-check.md):
cross-compiled on Linux with makensis 3.12 — zero warnings, valid PE32
Nullsoft self-extracting artifact, define-contract !error guards verified by
negative test. Fixes made during validation: StrFunc ${Using:StrFunc}
activation, description block reordered after Section definitions (the
original order silently broke hover descriptions), MULTIUSER_EXECUTIONLEVEL
define-name fix, registry-based Win10 gate (AtLeastWin10 does not exist in
stock WinVer.nsh). Runtime install matrix = T15 on Windows CI (pending).

Earlier this hour (same lane): engine/ advanced to core_recovery@5ddccd8
(latest main) with history preserved; build.ps1 engine-lane defects fixed
(artifact paths src/app|ui/Release, per-file --allowlist PE-gate invocation,
engine-kit DLL staging from the POST_BUILD-deployed set instead of hardcoded
z.dll/lz4.dll names); ui version files synced to VERSION 0.5.0 (the
Assert-VersionConsistency gate was throwing on every run).
