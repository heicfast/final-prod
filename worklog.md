# final-prod — Unified Product Worklog

Session log for the unified repository (engine + ui + driver + installer).
Created by the consolidation session on 2026-10-26 from:
- core_recovery @ a574ecf6cc06a374e1ee0f893e574efef4904639 (main)
- recovery-wizard-ui-new @ f4a8f8aebab625e9048d833cd9c3501741d7c436 (v3)
- rda-driver @ da7efb9e0c94046893c62b25695bb95edf519f8b (main)

This file records the product's ongoing session history. Component-local
history lives in engine/worklog.md, ui/worklog.md, driver/worklog.md
(preserved verbatim from the source repositories at merge time).

## 2026-10-26T11:40Z — engine/ advanced to core_recovery@5ddccd8 (latest main)

A parallel integration lane (same mandate, same sources) had already
pushed the T3–T6 state to `origin/main` (gate plan, context sheets,
three history-preserving component merges, contracts/, build entry
points). Per the mandate's coordination rules (pull frequently, never
force-push, leave main green) that state is adopted as canonical and
this lane builds on it. Convergence audit between the two lanes' plans:
both independently pinned the driver service name to `rda`/`RDA` (the
core hard-codes `\\.\RDA`), the same in-process cr_ui FFI bridge
architecture, ProgramData shared state, surfaced consent-gated driver
step, and MSIX exclusion.

This merge advances `engine/` from a574ecf to the latest core main
(5ddccd8, pushed 2026-10-26T10:31Z — after the adoption merge was cut):
a8a189e (rrecov/cr_ui Windows link fix + the new one-entry
cr_ui_exports.def), 7a76c86 (cr_ui_tests static core on MSVC), 5ddccd8
(Win7 import-allowlist for the S-014/S-010/M-033 wave). Verified before
merge: `engine/include/cr/cr_ui.h` unchanged — the 78-export ABI v2
surface the bridge targets is identical. Verified after merge:
`git diff core@5ddccd8 HEAD:engine` is empty except the deliberate
post-adoption `.github` removal (4 inert workflows). Rewritten
histories share ancestor a0405e83; full lineage preserved (repo now
1107 commits).
