# worklog.md — the live multi-agent session log

**Archive note:** the 2026-10-28 history bulk (17,690 lines, sessions 1
through the diff-fix waves) was removed from main via PR #13 (980d09c /
92bdff1); every entry remains retrievable from git history
(`git log --diff-filter=A -- worklog.md`). This file is the LIVE log —
each agent session appends its Task-ID entry here per the coordination
contract (handoffs, boundary items, convergence records).

Task ID: SCAN-2e-recon (Agent 2 — the S-090/A-011 + N-089 convergent-landing reconciliation)
Agent: Agent 2 (scan-engine lane)

Work Log:
- Collision resolved: the probe lane's A-011+N-089 landing (c899998)
  and this lane's unpushed S-090+N-089 fix (042f363, discarded) fixed
  the SAME two defects discovered independently in the same window
  (this lane's instrument: its first spec-correct BE SQLite fixtures
  went RED; the debug trail isolated the LE reads, then the
  `2ull << 30 / page_size` precedence parse = the 2-page cap).
- The landed A-011 decode supersedes this lane's draft on every
  dimension (the +56 text-encoding gate, the RetDec-export Analyse
  entry FUN_18002e2b0, the encoding-aware marker forms, the 4-page
  scan, the note-propagation mechanism) — no code kept from this
  lane's draft; the draft's S-090 finding file dropped (A-011 stands).
- Landed as THIS lane's reconciliation: the A-011 convergence record
  (the complementary Ghidra-side FUN_18002dfc1 :35404-35432 name-gate
  decode + the second-stage isolation fail-before: fixes held, subtype
  neutralized -> only the FCP-label test RED — the label-only proof
  N-089's severity rests on) + the SCAN-ENGINE-DELTA F2b row (A-011
  form) + this entry. The probe lane's OQ-SA-2 file already carries
  this lane's convergent resolutions (their :1463221 merge note).
- Verified on the landed state: full suite 932 passed / 0 failed
  (linux-release).

Stage Summary:
- The convergent landing reconciled with zero duplication: one code
  path (A-011's), one finding id per defect, both lanes' evidence
  merged into the record. The A2 session's net queue after this:
  OQ-SA-1's NTFS +0x64 half (narrowed probe), OQ-S4-3's TTFR half
  (execution-bound), the S-007 remainder. SCAN-ENGINE-DELTA.md is
  current with the board.

Task ID: API-FIX (the api-fix session — context recovery + the driver-era ABI drift batch + three CI-red repairs)
Agent: main engineer (API-focused remediation)

Work Log:
- Context recovery per protocol: three parallel read-legs (corpus /
  core / driver) produced the API ground-truth pack
  (/home/z/my-project/api-ctx/*.md, path:line-cited); the consolidated
  45-row present|inconsistent|missing|superset delta board is
  committed as diff-to-fix/API-DELTA.md.
- API-FIX-0 (1117ac9): repaired the two CI-red breakages the parallel
  lanes left (MSVC C4244 in the FH11 extent check -> integer drift
  check; clang-format violations in 9 files). Verified green on the CI
  lane's exact config (gcc-13+ASan; a matching local toolchain was
  bootstrapped under /home/z/gcc13 — gcc-14 mis-compares warnings).
- API-FIX-1..3 (c169332): the driver-era ABI-contract drift batch —
  the phantom-zero extended-IOCTL literal tail swept from 12 sites
  (0x6000244x -> 0x600244x, 3bda8e2's residue); cr_ui.h's phantom
  CR_UI_ERR_INVALID_PARAM and the unreachable "direct" transport
  value removed; ABI-CONTRACT §4 gains the ERR_DRIVER_* 0x500B
  family, §6 gains CR_EVT_FS_CHECK(10) + the M-041 struct tail, §7e
  rewritten driver-only; API.md 78->79 exports / v3 / 3 missing rows;
  CORE-API-CURRENT SUPERSEDED banner; API-SURFACE-AUDIT headline
  61->79@v3. Four doc-truth pins hold it (test_cr_ui.cpp).
- Format tail (630df04): the OQ-SA-1 lane's test_fat_volume.cpp
  comment alignment (the second format miss caught by local-mirror).
- Double-start repair (605d682): the v0.2.4 rda-driver installer
  (M-064's %s%d batch) starts the service itself; the
  install-driver composite action re-issued sc.exe start and failed
  the staged-scenarios lane on 1056 — the start step is now
  idempotent (RUNNING-query first; any other start failure stays
  fatal per the v0.2.3 exit-code lesson).
- Driver repo state (read-only): rda-driver's own doc drifts (D2 stale
  0x6000244x in docs/architecture.md, D3 stale 15/18-command counts
  vs the 19-code set, D4 invalid hex(7) UpperFilters data) recorded in
  the delta pack — that repo's lane owns them (it has active lanes;
  single-repo commit discipline held here).

Stage Summary:
- The API surface's normative docs now match the driver-only code they
  describe, with 4 regression pins; three CI-red states repaired
  across the session; the remaining API-scope board: S-038 step-2+
  (installer implementation, packaging lane), A-ABI-6 (codeql policy —
  owner call), rda-driver D2/D3/D4 doc drifts. Suites verified green:
  969/969 (my batch), CI success on 1117ac9 + 630df04.

Task ID: API-FIX-2 (api-fix session 2 — the post-A-011 CLI/CRSF doc truth pass)
Agent: api-fix lane (this session)

Work Log:
- Context-recovery protocol re-run, API scope only: three parallel
  read legs (corpus / core / driver) -> the session-2 delta board in
  diff-to-fix/API-DELTA.md §4 (Session 2).
- Session-1 board re-verified first-hand: driver wire byte-exact vs
  rda_ioctl.h (identity 0x60002400/04/08 + extended 0x6002440/44/48 +
  all 19 session codes + F11 x512); 79 cr_ui exports recounted;
  39+OK error codes recounted; CLI dispatch = 10 verbs (code truth).
- Rebase reconciliation: the remote lanes landed M-064 FULLY FIXED
  upstream (rda-driver v0.2.4 323e75a: -Layout Versioned %s%d
  coexistence + -Uninstall verb + versioned-aware teardown + PS AST
  CI gate) and the A-011/N-089 convergence (fc74677) while this
  session verified — the board row reconciled; core's driver-status
  discovery confirmed unaffected (the service carries the binPath).
- Four NEW verified drift items (all doc-vs-code, zero code defects):
  A: docs/crsf-format.md omits REC_FS_CHECK type 9 (M-041) and its
  payload grammar; B: the rrecov.cpp header comment lists 8 of 10
  verbs + misses scan --image/--deep/--repair-undo/--user-signs and
  recover --image; C: docs/API.md §1 the same 8-of-10 verb gap + a
  phantom [plan] value on --repair (bare flag at rrecov.cpp:1089) +
  a duplicate exit-code row 3; D: docs/CORE-API-CURRENT.md §c says
  9 verbs (omits driver, stale wmain cite) and c.7/c.8/c.9 still
  document the REMOVED --no-rda flag + the "direct" transport label
  (only "rda" exists, rrecov.cpp:1992) + stale function-range cites.
- Fixes A-D landing as separate commits (the three-site verb-list
  pin: docs/API.md + CORE-API-CURRENT §c + the rrecov.cpp header
  comment must move together from now on).

Stage Summary:
- The API lane's remaining board after this session: S-038 steps 2-4
  (packaging lane, owner decisions pending), A-ABI-6 (owner policy),
  OQ-SA-1/OQ-S4-3 (engine-scope probes). Everything API-surface-shaped
  is now doc-consistent with the code at the tree this session pins.
